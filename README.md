Make sure you have discord.py installed (You can install it in the command line with "pip install discord")
and mcstatus (You can install it in the command line with "pip install mcstatus"

Run the configbot.py before anything. This will create a file
called psConfig.txt that will store your configuration for this program.

As it's pretty obvious, run the runbot.py to get your bot going
afterwards.

To ping your bot just @mention it.

If you can't paste in your bot's run token, either
run configbot.py from the IDLE editor, or
input whatever you want and then edit the
second value in psConfig.txt, it's after "True;"
