# MCPD **Uptime**
**Version 1.0**

A discord bot you host yourself, that will display the amount of people in a specified Minecraft Server as well as it's uptime

**WRITTEN IN PYTHON VERSION 3.6**

Depends on

> discord.py

> mcstatus

<sup>Install them with pip on the command line.</sup>

## Before Running
Make sure you have edited `MCPDConfig.py` to your liking, or
else the bot will not work.

<b>In the config is the `cPrompt` variable, what you set it to, is what
will call the bot for it's commands.</b>

## General Use
Run your bot with the `runbot.py` file from a python 3 interpreter.

To get all of the commands listed in discord, send `<prompt> help` in a channel that your bot can access

To ping your bot send `<prompt> ping`

To get the link to this Github repo, send `<prompt> source`

## New in branch Uptime
The main point of `Uptime` is to ditch user input and have all functions of
the bot done automatically.

* Remove `<prompt> list`
* Set a "point of contact" user that will be notified if the bot does not
	get a response from the server.
