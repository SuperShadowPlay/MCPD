Run the `configbot.py` file in a python 3 interpreter. This will
create a file called psConfig.txt in the same directory/folder as `configbot.py` 
that will store your configuration for this program.

The `runbot.py` and `psConfig.txt` **must** be in the same directory/folder to run.

Run your bot with the `runbot.py` file from a python 3 interpreter

To ping your bot send "@\<bot> ping" in a channel that your bot can access

## Troubleshooting/Contact Info
If you can't paste in your bot's run token, either
run configbot.py from the IDLE editor, or
input whatever you want and then edit the
second value in psConfig.txt, it's after "True;"
